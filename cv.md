**Sunrise Company. Moscow.**  
_Asp.net developer, development of industrial automation systems._  
I was working as Asp.net developer(backend) for 3 years. Sunrise software worked simultaneously on many computers and electronic systems. User actions on the Asp.net site led to processes that ran on numerous computers. And also the processes that were actively performed on many electronic devices. My code had to actively interact with electronic devices that do not have an operating system, including having a direct effect on electronic circuits. In solving these problems, my experience of low-level programming proved to be especially valuable.
